Running performance benchmark... This may take a few moments.

*** Performance Comparison Report ***

Average Latency (Stateful): 0.000020 seconds
Average Latency (Stateless): 0.000004 seconds
Throughput (Stateful): 1.46 MB
Throughput (Stateless): 1.46 MB
Average CPU Usage (Stateful): 0.81%
Average CPU Usage (Stateless): 0.58%
Average Memory Usage (Stateful): 84.00%
Average Memory Usage (Stateless): 84.00%

Stateful filtering tracks connections, introducing more latency and higher CPU/memory usage.
Stateless filtering treats packets independently, resulting in lower latency but at the cost of connection awareness.
