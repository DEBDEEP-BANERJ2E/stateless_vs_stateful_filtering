*** Performance Comparison Report ***

Average Latency (Stateful): 0.000017 seconds
Average Latency (Stateless): 0.000003 seconds
Throughput (Stateful): 0.98 MB
Throughput (Stateless): 0.98 MB
Average CPU Usage (Stateful): 0.60%
Average CPU Usage (Stateless): 0.20%
Average Memory Usage (Stateful): 84.31%
Average Memory Usage (Stateless): 84.31%

Stateful filtering tracks connections, introducing more latency and higher CPU/memory usage.
Stateless filtering treats packets independently, resulting in lower latency but at the cost of connection awareness.
